# GitterBot

Two ways to run bot:

#1 app.js
ROOM_NAME=&#60;user/roomName&#62; [GITTER_KEY=&#60;OAUTH KEY&#62; GITTER_SECRET=&#60;OAUTH SECRET&#62;] node app.js
and go through authorization process.

#2 script.js 
ROOM_NAME=&#60;user/roomName&#62; [TOKEN=&#60;TOKEN&#62;] node script.js
just go to the room that you choose.
